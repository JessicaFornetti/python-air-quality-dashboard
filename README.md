This dashboard includes a bar chart of AQI values for various large cities and a table showing the JSON request, the AQI value and the city name.

# Repository Overview
This repository contains 2 Python scripts: [airQuality](airQuality.py) and [app](app.py).

**airQuality** fetches AQI data dynamically from the [WAQI API](https://aqicn.org/api/) for specified cities and stores it in MongoDB allowing the dashboard to be refreshed with real-time data.

**app** builds a locally run Dash web application to visualize the air quality dashboard.
